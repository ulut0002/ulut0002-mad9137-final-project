#  Doors Open Ottawa - MAD9137 Final Project

## Description
This project is a mobile app designed to showcase the Doors Open Ottawa festival for iOS users. Users can search for attractions by keyword and filter them by category. The app also displays the distance to each attraction from the user's current location.

The application leverages Observable classes for dynamic data handling.

This application is the most complex iOS app I have designed as of June 2024.
